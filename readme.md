# Virtual Button Box

Virtual Button Box is a program for the HTC Vive that lets you place flat panels in 3D space that contain buttons. Clicking a button sends a keyboard key press or key combination. The panels are defined using a separate profile editing program.

It is designed with DCS World in mind, but will work in any VR game that accepts keyboard input.
